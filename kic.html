https://indy.fulgan.com/mirrorinfo.txt
As of January 2020, the Indz source code is not available from this mirror anymore:
The indy source control system has been migrated to github. 
There is therefore no need for extra tools in order to download the latest snapshot.
All source code can be accessed from https://github.com/IndySockets
The Indy SSL libraries will remain here for the time being.
